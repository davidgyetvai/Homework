//CODING CHALLENGE #2

/*
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark'sBMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

GOOD LUCK 


const markWeightData1 = 78;
const markHeightData1 = 1.69;
const johnWeightData1 = 92;
const johnHeightData1 = 1.95;

const markBMI1 = markWeightData1 / (markHeightData1 * markHeightData1);
const johnBMI1 = johnWeightData1 / (johnHeightData1 * johnHeightData1);


if (markBMI1 > johnBMI1) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI1}) is higher then John's BMI (${johnBMI1})!`)
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI1}) is higher then Mark's BMI (${markBMI1})!`)
