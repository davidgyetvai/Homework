'use strict'

//CODING CHALLENGE #1

/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK 


let markWeightData1 = 78;
let markHeightData1 = 1.69;
let johnWeightData1 = 92;
let johnHeightData1 = 1.95;

let markBMI1 = markWeightData1 / (markHeightData1 * markHeightData1);
let johnBMI1 = johnWeightData1 / (johnHeightData1 * johnHeightData1);
//console.log(markBMI1, johnBMI1);

let markHigherBMI1 = (markBMI1 > johnBMI1);
//console.log(markHigherBMI1);

let markWeightData2 = 95;
let markHeightData2 = 1.88;
let johnWeightData2 = 85;
let johnHeightData2 = 1.76;

let markBMI2 = markWeightData2 / (markHeightData2 * markHeightData2);
let johnBMI2 = johnWeightData2 / (johnHeightData2 * johnHeightData2);
//console.log(markBMI2, johnBMI2);

let markHigherBMI2 = (markBMI2 > johnBMI2);
console.log(markHigherBMI2);*/
